Recently I've been exploring how to add events automatically to calendars. I had two requirements
in mind when looking for tools or services:

1. Events should be added automatically to users' calendars when they sign up for an event.
2. Users should be able to connect their accounts to a third-party calendar provider like Google.

You can use [iCalendar events (.ics files)](https://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/) with
email attachments to fulfill these two requirements. This approach works for both Google and Outlook
calendars, but more importantly, it takes less effort to implement because you don't need to handle
the user's authorization. I highly recommend this option if you don't need extra features that
require access to the user's data (like calendar availability).

I wrote a [quick guide to generate iCalendar events (.ics files)](https://gist.github.com/flandrade/394d9df95e1be2a584f267ae91505239)
that will be added automatically to any Google or Outlook calendar. You can also find a summary in [this answer from Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68042842/5924089).

Alternatively, if your application supports [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2),
you can add Google Calendar API to sync calendar events. There are two official libraries to
implement this integration, but I found the documentation can be hard to follow. For this reason,
I wrote a [tutorial to walk you through the process](https://gist.github.com/flandrade/a943a47e3575fb8805499e18e6b23c07)
of adding an API to an existing Google Sign-In integration. In case you're using
[react-google-login](https://github.com/anthonyjgrove/react-google-login), you might find
[my contribution](https://github.com/anthonyjgrove/react-google-login/pull/455) helpful as well.
