I never planned to be a manager. Like many engineers, I just wanted to build great software and
solve interesting problems. But as the work grew more complex, I found myself spending less time
debugging code and more time trying to understand people: how they think, how they communicate, how
they make decisions together. The hardest challenges in tech were never just technical; they were
human.

Building software at scale changes the kinds of questions you ask. Why is it so hard to do
consistently well? How do you get many people moving in the same direction without losing creativity
or momentum? How do you make products that not only work but genuinely help someone? Over time, I
began to see that good engineering and good leadership rely on the same instincts: curiosity,
adaptability when things don’t go as planned, and a genuine care for how technology and people work
together.

For me, leadership came gradually. I started as the first woman in a small tech company, grew into
senior engineer, then tech lead, and eventually VP of Engineering. Each step forced me to see the
work differently: the systems, the people, the trade-offs. I used to think good engineering was
mostly about logic and precision. It turns out it's more nuanced than that.

Over the years, those questions have shaped how I work and how I lead. A few lessons have stayed
with me:

- **Software quality**. Early in my career, I didn’t have a clear grasp of what it truly takes to
  build high-quality software. I learned that computer science foundations matter more than the
  tools. But ultimately, good practices don’t mean much unless you build a culture where people are
  genuinely driven by the goal of delivering quality work.

- **Recruiting and growing talent**. Writing code is not the hardest part of our job. What’s
  difficult is finding people who care about growing into better developers. Learning how to
  identify those people is tough, and during my time recruiting I focused on building a process to
  do exactly that: treat people with respect, identify talent, and help it grow. More importantly, I
  learned how to cultivate that passion and energy into becoming exceptional developers. If there’s
  something I’m most proud of, it’s the amazing people I mentored.

- **Acknowledging mistakes**. We all make mistakes, but what matters is how we acknowledge them with
  our teams. As a manager, when was the last time you admitted a mistake? For me, it took years to
  learn how to do this without seeing it as a personal defeat. Over time, I realized it’s one of the
  most powerful tools for building trust.

- **Exceptional results are driven by motivated people**. Exceptional engineers are easy to spot,
  they make life easier for everyone, they strive for quality, and they don’t wait to be asked. If
  they see problems, they fix them. But being exceptional isn’t easy; it requires energy, effort,
  and, above all, caring about the company’s vision.

- **Our responsibility as managers is to match that effort**. As engineers strive for excellence, we
  must do more than reward their behavior, we must also create the conditions for
  [organizational health](https://lethain.com/membership-opportunity), so they feel empowered to
  help build a stronger company. Exceptional talent should also be trusted to hold leadership
  accountable, because in a healthy organization, responsibility isn't one-sided.

- **Trust**. We often hear about open-door policies, but they don't mean much if your direct report
  has never once told you that you're wrong or they avoid disagreeing with you. On the flip side,
  even the best engineers make mistakes sometimes, and it's perfectly fine to inspect their work and
  call it out. Trust cannot be blind; otherwise it turns into neglect. But inspection cannot be
  constant either. The answer to this might be
  [adapting our leadership style to the situation](https://lethain.com/developing-leadership-styles).

- **Radical candor and cultural differences**. Candor works differently across cultures, and
  understanding those nuances is crucial to building trust without creating friction.

- But above all, none of these points matter if the business doesn’t succeed. Our job is to deliver:
  to build reliable products, to collaborate across teams, and to make the company stronger.

Becoming a manager taught me a lot about people, what motivates them, what slows them down, and what
helps them do their best work. It also taught me a lot about myself: how I react when things get
uncertain, how I make decisions when there isn't a clear answer, how I recover from mistakes, and
how much empathy and clarity matter when leading through uncertainty.

I don't know what comes next, and maybe that's a good thing. I just hope to keep learning, building,
and leading with the same curiosity and care that made me want to start in the first place.
