[Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) is a service that provides time tracking for small
businesses. They provide numerous reports to make sure projects are healthy. However, although you
can keep track of employees' working time, there is no visibility of overtime details.

For this reason, I'm happy to announce
[harvest-overtime](https://github.com/flandrade/harvest-overtime). It's a command-line interface to
calculate employee's overtime with
[Harvest's CSV reports](https://help.getharvest.com/harvest/reports/managing-harvest-reports/time-report/).
The goal of this tool is to provide the information to calculate overtime pay correctly.

### Features ‚ú®

- Calculates overtime: generates a report or prints to the command line.
- Includes total time per day and an overtime report of both weekdays and weekends.
- Supports any reporting period. It can be a week or several months.
- Supports standard full-time work (40 hours per week: 8 hours per day), but you can change this
  value.
