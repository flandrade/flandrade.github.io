title: Novel Dataset for Interactive Segmentation Evaluation
date: 2015-07-25 18:32:52
summary:
  We present a novel seed-based user input dataset that extends the well-known GrabCut dataset and
  the Geodesic Star convexity dataset. Here, user inputs are provided by means of two sets of
  scribbles that reflect two degrees of user effort.

This dataset consists of 50 images, ground-truth data and two sets of _scribbles_, and it has been
made publicly [available](https://github.com/flandrade/dataset-interactive-algorithms). As can be
seen, the images contain an object that could be unambiguously extracted by users.

For this compilation, the publicly available
[GrabCut](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/visionimagevideoediting/segmentation/grabcut.htm)
and [Geodesic Star convexity dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/iseg/#Dataset) were
taken as starting point. Original images and ground-truth data are from the GrabCut database.

User inputs are provided by means of two sets of _scribbles_ which indicate foreground and
background regions. For the first set, we use the _scribbles_ for initializing robot user from the
Geodesic Star Convexit dataset. These employ on average about 4 strokes per image, yet they mark a
small area of the foreground object. Finally, a new set of _scribbles_ was created in order to
extend this dataset. In this set, the _scribbles_ indicate and mark in more detail the foreground
region.

These sets reflect two degrees of user effort: the second set marks in more detail foreground
regions when compared to the first set of _scribbles_.
