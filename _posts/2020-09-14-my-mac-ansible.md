I [published a set of Ansible playbooks][my repository] to setup, configure, and maintain my MacOS.
They set up a full local development environment with a single command, but also provide specific
commands to update more granular settings.

As a result, these playbooks take most of the effort out of installing and configuring everything
manually.

Everything needed to use and customize these playbooks is documented in
[my repository](https://github.com/flandrade/my-mac). Feel free to explore, adapt, or copy code for
your playbook!

## üìñ What you'll get?

These playbooks will do four main tasks:

- **App installations:** Command-line tools and applications installed with the fantastic [Ansible's
  Homebrew role] by Jeff Geerling. It installs and configures packages, taps, and cask apps
  according to supplied variables.

- **zsh installation:** The zsh role configures [zsh] and installs the configuration framework
  [prezto].

- **Dotfile configuration:** [This role][dotfiles role] downloads the dotfiles from my [dotfile
  repository] and it symlinks them with [Stow]. It's possible to replace this repository and use
  your own but make sure you're using [Stow]. In addition, the role also configures [vscode]: you
  can change the installed extensions by modifying the supplied variables.

- **OSX configuration:** The osx role runs a script to modify the default macOS preferences. I'm
  using the [original script] by Mathias Bynens.
