I’m a software engineer curious about how we can build better software. I enjoy solving challenging
problems with technology and thinking about how systems, and the people behind them, can work
together more effectively. Sometimes I speak at [conferences]({{ site.url }}/talks/) and write
[articles]({{ site.url }}/publications/) about what I’ve learned along the way.

Over the years, I’ve explored how to make complex software more correct and maintainable through
functional programming, strong type systems, and thoughtful design. That curiosity led me to pursue
a Master’s in Formal Methods at [UPM](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=inicio&idioma=english) and
[IMDEA](https://software.imdea.org/), where I
[studied](https://oa.upm.es/75865/1/TFM_FERNANDA_ANDRADE_GUANOQUIZA.pdf) how mathematical reasoning
can help us build more trustworthy software.

I currently work as a senior software engineer focused on web development. My expertise lies in
software testing and functional programming, with a strong understanding of how to use type systems
to design robust APIs and write expressive, reliable tests that fail only for useful reasons.

I've also led engineering teams, setting direction, mentoring developers, and learning that building
software at scale is as much about people as it is about technology. Over time, I've come to see
that good engineering and good leadership rely on the same instincts: curiosity, clarity, and
genuine care for how technology and people work together.

More importantly, I care deeply about cultivating a culture where people can grow, learn, and create
with confidence. Mentoring and helping other engineers develop their craft has been one of the most
rewarding parts of my work.
