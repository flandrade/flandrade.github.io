I'm a software engineer curious about how we can build better software. I enjoy solving challenging
problems with technology. Sometimes I speak at [conferences](https://ferandrade.com/talks/) and
write articles.

I've spent a lot of time exploring how to make complex software more correct and manageable with
functional programming and static types. This drive has led me to deep dive into formal methods to
build a better intuition of what it means to create more reliable software.

I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Formal Methods at
[UPM](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=inicio&idioma=english), [UCM](https://informatica.ucm.es), and
[UAM](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio). I also work as a tech lead at Stack Builders where I lead
teams to turn ideas into pragmatic and scalable implementations with various programming languages,
including Haskell and TypeScript.

My specialties are software testing and functional programming for web development. Iâ€™m good at
writing expressive and reliable tests that only fail for useful reasons and leveraging type systems
to build robust APIs that work as intended. I also like digging into obscure bugs and building
appealing front-end apps.

More importantly, I care deeply about cultivating an inclusive culture of respect that encourages
growth. I find joy in mentoring and helping engineers' careers thrive.
