Hi, I’m a functional programmer based in Quito, Ecuador. I like to think beyond conventional technology and explore new ideas to meet current challenges.

I consider myself a student, a learner, an enthusiastic about coding. I spend a great deal of my spare time learning new languages or improving my coding skills. I’m currently focused on Haskell, but I also like to work with Front-End. Not JavaScript framework fatigue so far, especially if I'm able to play with Elm, React and TypeScript.  

As a developer, I enjoy working across disciplines to challenge the boundaries between technology and humanities. I firmly believe they both elevate each other, and it’s undeniable that understanding different perspectives is important to address common issues.

When I’m not coding, I read.
