Hi there, I'm Fernanda Andrade. I’m a full-stack developer with meticulous attention to
detail, communication, and a love for functional programming and static types.

After having studied electronic engineering I decided to make a career out of my interest
in programming. I've been building web applications ever since and I've worked on a wide
variety of projects with various programming languages, but I'm particularly keen on
Haskell and TypeScript.

When I’m not coding, I read and travel. I've been to Vietnam, Singapore, Cambodia, Japan,
and numerous cities in Europe. I have logged quite a few kilometers on the Andean
region and I am looking forward to exploring the Pyrenees.
